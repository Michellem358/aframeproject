        This is a thrilling virtual reality game where you must overcome a series of obstacles to earn your freedom. Your journey begins in a winding maze, where you must navigate carefully while avoiding the wolves that chase you. Collect as many coins as possible—but watch out for hidden ambushes! If a wolf catches you, you’ll lose a life and have to start over.
	Once you escape the maze, new challenges await. Leap across platforms without falling, jump over bars, and stay alert to avoid the lurking spiders. Every step brings you closer to freedom—will you make it to the end?
